  <p>I adored Copenhagen, the city of biking. I had one extra day and I spent it biking around till I
    was exhausted, enjoying the bike lanes that crisscrossed the city. I biked to the restaurants
    in the port area and ended up sharing a table with a Norwegian family who made sure I
    tasted every kind of herring, twice. (“Curry herring”, Denmark?) I biked all the way south to
    Christania, the original “Occupy” to see how it fared as a tourist attraction. I biked back
    through the rain, undeterred, as I felt safe in separated bike lines as families with kids’
    wagons and shopping carts attached to their bikes whizzed past me. Biking is wonderful
    and I was determined to enjoy it for once in a city that prioritized biking. I’m all for biking
    and bikeable cities.</p>

  <p>I fumed when my bike got stolen in college. Hey, I’m still angry.
    Biking is a great way to get around. Bike-friendly cities provide
    some of the best quality of life. And many cities that are getting
    awash in money, mostly from the tech industry, are doing more
    to install bike lanes. And as biking becomes a favored hobby,
    the same tech industry employees, many of whom are young,
    are buying more and more expensive bikes.</p>

  <p>And these bikes are getting stolen more and more, reported
    the New York Times, so the San Francisco Police Department is
    now using “bait bikes” equipped with GPS to lure thieves to steal these bikes, which are on
    purpose made expensive enough so that the thieves can be charged with a felony.</p>

  <p>The story was written so cheerily, and so clearly aimed at anyone who recognizes the anger
    one feels towards such petty crime, that one could almost forget what was actually
    happening.</p>
